# Freestyle Libre Integration Setup

## 🚧 Current Status: In Development

The Freestyle Libre integration is currently in development due to API limitations from Abbott.

## 🔍 Technical Challenges

### Abbott LibreView API Limitations
Unlike Dexcom, Abbott does not provide:
- Public OAuth API for third-party applications
- Developer portal for API access
- Direct real-time data access

### Current Approach
We're exploring several integration methods:

1. **LibreView Data Export**
   - Manual CSV export from LibreView
   - Automated parsing and import
   - Historical data analysis

2. **NFC Reader Integration** (Future)
   - Direct sensor reading via NFC
   - Mobile app integration
   - Real-time data capture

3. **Third-party APIs** (Research Phase)
   - Investigating available unofficial APIs
   - Community-driven solutions
   - Data aggregation services

## 📋 Database Schema Ready

The database tables are prepared for when the integration becomes available:

```sql
-- Tables created by migration
freestyle_tokens          -- OAuth tokens (when available)
freestyle_sync_settings   -- User sync preferences
freestyle_sync_log        -- Sync activity logs
```

## 🎯 Planned Features

### Phase 1: Manual Import
- [ ] LibreView CSV import
- [ ] Data validation and parsing
- [ ] Sensor record creation
- [ ] Historical data analysis

### Phase 2: Semi-Automated
- [ ] Scheduled CSV processing
- [ ] Email-based data import
- [ ] Notification system

### Phase 3: Real-time (If API becomes available)
- [ ] OAuth integration
- [ ] Real-time sync
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Device status monitoring

## 🔧 Current Implementation

The integration framework is built and ready:

### Components Created
- ✅ **FreestyleSettings Component**: UI ready for when API is available
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Tables and relationships defined
- ✅ **API Routes**: Placeholder endpoints for future implementation
- ✅ **Settings Integration**: Integrated into main settings page

### Environment Variables (Placeholder)
```bash
FREESTYLE_CLIENT_ID=your_freestyle_client_id
FREESTYLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_freestyle_client_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_FREESTYLE_CLIENT_ID=your_freestyle_client_id
FREESTYLE_API_BASE_URL=https://api-eu.libreview.io
```

## 📈 Alternative Solutions

### Manual Data Import
Users can currently:
1. Export data from LibreView as CSV
2. Manually add sensor records
3. Track sensor changes and performance
4. Use the existing sensor management features

### Community Integration
We're monitoring:
- Abbott's developer announcements
- Community-driven API solutions
- Third-party integration services
- Open-source LibreView tools

## 🚀 Future Updates

The integration will be activated when:
- Abbott releases a public API
- Reliable third-party solutions become available
- Community APIs reach production stability
