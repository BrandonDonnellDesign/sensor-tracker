# Dynamic Roadmap Setup Guide

## 🚀 Overview

The dynamic roadmap system allows you to manage your product roadmap directly from the database, with real-time updates and admin controls.

## 📋 Setup Steps

### 1. Run Database Migrations

```bash
# Apply all migrations including roadmap tables and initial data
supabase db push

# This will run:
# - 20241216000002_create_roadmap_tables.sql (creates tables, indexes, RLS policies)
# - 20241216000003_populate_initial_roadmap_data.sql (populates initial roadmap data)
```

### 2. Set Up Admin User

```sql
-- Update your user to have admin role
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';
```

### 3. Verify Installation

1. **Check Tables**: Ensure these tables exist in your Supabase database:
   - `roadmap_items`
   - `roadmap_features` 
   - `roadmap_dependencies`
   - `roadmap_tags`

2. **Check Data**: The migration should have populated initial roadmap data automatically.

3. **Test Admin Access**: 
   - Login with your admin account
   - Navigate to `/admin` - you should see the admin dashboard
   - Go to `/admin/roadmap` to manage roadmap items

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Categories
```sql
-- Categories are defined in the service file, but you can add new ones:
-- Edit: web/lib/roadmap-service.ts
-- Add to categoryOptions array
```

### Adding New Icons
```sql
-- Icons are mapped in the service file:
-- Edit: web/lib/roadmap-service.ts  
-- Add to iconMap and iconOptions
```

### Custom Statuses
```sql
-- Statuses are constrained in the database:
-- Modify the CHECK constraint in the migration if needed
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Admin Access Issues
```sql
-- Check if user has admin role
SELECT id, email, role FROM profiles WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Grant admin role
UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### Missing Data
```sql
-- Check if roadmap items exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM roadmap_items;

-- If empty, the initial data migration may not have run
-- Re-run migrations: supabase db push
-- Or manually run: web/supabase/migrations/20241216000003_populate_initial_roadmap_data.sql
```

### Real-time Updates Not Working
- Check Supabase real-time is enabled for your project
- Verify RLS policies are correctly set
- Check browser console for WebSocket connection errors
