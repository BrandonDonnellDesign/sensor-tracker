## 📝 Sample Feedback Data

The system comes pre-populated with realistic feedback examples:

This gives admins immediate data to work with and shows users how the system works.

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

The feedback system is now fully functional and integrated into your application. Users can submit feedback from the roadmap page, and admins can manage it through the admin dashboard. The system is designed to scale and can handle thousands of feedback items efficiently.
