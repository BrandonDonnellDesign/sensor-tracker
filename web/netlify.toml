# Notes:
# - Ensure `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` is installed as a dependency in your `web`
#   package.json before deploying. Netlify's docs recommend adding the plugin
#   and leaving the rest to the plugin, which will set up serverless functions
#   and routing automatically.
# - If you use Next middleware or Edge runtimes, confirm plugin support and
#   check Netlify docs for any extra configuration.
